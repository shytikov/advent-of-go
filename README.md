# Advent of Go

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/).

To run solution:

```bash
cd year/day # i.e. cd 2021/01
go run .
```

N.B. Sole purpose of this attempt is to unnecessary overengineer the code to finally focus on awesome GO's multithreading features instead of just cracking algorithms one by one. This is also my `vim-go` mastery playground as the code is developed via SSH on remote `Radxa Zero` SBC.
