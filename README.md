# Advent of Go

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/).

To run solution:

```bash
cd year/day # i.e. cd 2021/01
go run .
```

N.B. Sole purpose of this attempt is to unnecessary overengineer the code to finally focus on awesome Go multithreading features instead of just cracking algorithms one by one.
